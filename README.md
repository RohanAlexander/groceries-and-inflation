## Getting Started

### Requirements

This project requires both the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/). If you do not have these tools in your development environment, please install them now. You will also need an integrated development environment (IDE) capable of running R scripts. I recommend [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) (local) or [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) (cloud-based).

Once your environment is set up, you must install several packages that handle various tasks, like graphing data, creating tables, and general organization and processing. You will find a complete list of these packages in the file `scripts/00-install_dependencies.r`. You only need to run this file once to install the required dependencies.
